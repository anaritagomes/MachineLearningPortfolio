# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
A repository that showcases a portfolio of Data Science and Machine Learning projects I have undertaken for academic, self-improvement, and recreational purposes.
## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
- Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
- Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
